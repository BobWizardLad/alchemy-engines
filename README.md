Alchemy Engines is a turn-based tactical roleplaying game about leading a mobile settlement of survivors through a wasteland plagued with shadow beasts. The survivors use alchemy engines, vehicles that run off potions brewed on an industrial scale. The survivors battle these beasts from alchemy engines to clear a path for the settlement.

On the tactical layer, the player will command a squad of vehicles on a square grid map in turn-based battles. This will involve movement, attacks, environmental interactions, and decision making to address enemies positioned on the map. The player can either complete the objective through commanding their squad or see all squad members be defeated. 

On the strategic layer, the player needs to keep the city moving as one unit across the map to each point of interest. This can be foiled by obstacles in the path in the form of battles to be resolved, by running out of fuel and being stranded, or by no longer having any units.

The player relies on alchemy to survive the strategic layer and uses it as a game-changing tool in the tactical layer. The enemies use shadows to reposition themselves across the tactical map and can use this ability to put pressure on the player. The player needs to prepare and think ahead to make effective use of their potion mechanics, and the enemies can impulsively use shadows to outflank.
